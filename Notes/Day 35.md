# Day 35

### Date: August 5, 2019

### Topic

Practitioner 

### Notes

- Added linting and formatting. Took some time to get kondo to ignore mount. Should add it to github actions next.
- Canâ€™t figure out exactly how workflows are triggered. Read through docs a bit more. Think [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63480433/how-to-run-a-github-action-from-a-branch-other-than-master) explains it. Not quite sure I understand though.
- Tried using [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to test the action locally. Donâ€™t know if it works properly tried to get it to fail purposely and it didnâ€™t work. Probably set it up wrong will just try directly on GitHub actions tomorrow.
