### Notes

- Tried to add mount. Itâ€™s interesting.  Couldnâ€™t get it to start a server and carry out the migrations together. Seems to do one but not the other. Maybe I could set it up better?
- Tried rewriting the migration functions and not happy with it but it should be fine. Doing it in a different way to the documentation so i donâ€™t think iâ€™m going in the right direction
- Messed around with hiccup so thats seemingly working.
