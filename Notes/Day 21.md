# Day 21

### Date: August 31, 2022

### Topic

Cli

### Notes

- Went through PR and made the corrections.
    - predicate-test (No question marks)
- Added user input to choose what next action will be. Maybe need to rename  `user-input-position` .
- Used failjure to validate input. Not quite sure if its right though, especially in `user-input-position`. Read more about Either monad
- Want to add a method to quit in between the game (Idk how, but canâ€™t be that hard). Also tests
