# Day 12

### Date: August 17, 2022

### Topic

Tic Tac Toe

### Notes

- Both diag funcs look the same? how to make them one?
- Calling multiple functions with same inputs
- Doesn’t work for invalid inputs
- Make it more general so that it works even if input is a 4

### Topic

Laziness (sigh)

### Notes

- Homoiconicity, data structures are the same as those used to represent the code. "code as data". Makes it easy to operate on code. (Lisp thing, nothing to do with laziness but whatever)
- lazy-seq → macro return a lazy seq with the passed function as body
- Lazy-Seq.seq → unwraps layers of the seq until we get to first non lazy value or realised value.
