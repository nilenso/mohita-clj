# Day 10

### Date: August 12, 2022

### Topic

Lazyness

### Notes

- Head â†’ first unrealized element
- Thunk â†’ inside every head, uninvoked closure
- Evaluated â†’ Partially evaluated â†’ unevaluated
- [To make a lazy sequence](https://otee.dev/2022/01/17/lazy-clojure.html) use the `lazy-seq` fn wrapped around the recusive call.
    - Cannot use recur here as it will not be a tail call.
    - use cons instead of conj â†’ (Idk why it causes a stackoverflow for some reason)
    - when Clojure sees lazy-seq it stops computation until it is realized.
- Realizes in chunks. 32 members will be evaluated
- This behaviour seemed weird. `(range)` uses iterate which doesnâ€™t support chunking. `(range end)` uses LongRange that supports chunking

```clojure
(first (map (fn [x] (prn x) x) (range)))
0
=>0
(first (map (fn [x] (prn x) x) (range 100)))
0-31
=> 0
```

### Topic

WEWUT

### Notes

- Tests should be as small as possible. Trivial to understand.Make the number of places to inspect as small as possible.
- Each test should be consided itâ€™s own universe
- Expect literals. Some tests are so small calling a fn that returns a string is pointless
- Remove setup, make direct calls
- DAMP over DRY

### Topic

[Re-Implement Iteration](https://4clojure.oxal.org/#/problem/62)

### Notes

- Similar to 60. Conj didnâ€™t work here either for the same reason Iâ€™m assuming. Donâ€™t know what that reason is :â€™)
- Maybe [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12389303/clojure-cons-vs-conj-with-lazy-seq#:~:text=Cons%20object%2C%20which%20is%20what,call%20on%20the%20collection%20itself.).
