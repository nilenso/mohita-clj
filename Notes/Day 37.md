### Notes

- So I got postgres working. So i tried a few different things and it turns out that part where i assigned the db name wasnâ€™t indented properly. So that was fun.
- Also figured out how to upload an artifact. Think I did it correctly since its passing not sure how to double check.
- Tried deploying to render. Had to containerise the project first. Having a little bit of trouble getting the server to connect to ~~postgres~~ something? Hopefully I can get it running tomorrow.
