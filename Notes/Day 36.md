Practitioner

### Notes

- Divided the action in to different job. Think it looks a lot better now. Not perfect but I feel better about it.
- Cached the dependancies so they wouldnâ€™t be reinstalled every time i use them.
- Finally understood how an event causes a trigger
    - each commit has a hash. whenever i push to github or make a PR github checks to see if there are actions in the workflow directory. So if main does not have an action and a branch does. the action will only be carried out for the branch.
- Try not to use xxx-latest specify the type. the latest version may change and break code.
- Added postgress to the workflow but a connection is being refused for some reason. will try and figure that out tomorrow
- G&L was interesting got to learn about audacity and making videos
