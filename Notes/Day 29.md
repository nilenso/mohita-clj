# Day 29

### Date: August 5, 2019

### Topic

12 factor app

### Notes

- Codebase: app has single codebase. If code is shared make them libraries. Multiple deploys are possible
- Dependancies: all explicitly declared and isolated. simplifies build for new devs. Does not depend on system tools
- Config: No credentials should compromised. use environment variables. independent for each deploy
