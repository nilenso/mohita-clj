CPS

### Notes

- Steps for cps

```markdown
1. Pass extra parameter
2. Whenever the function returns an expression that doesn't contain function calls, send that expression to the continuation cont instead
3. Whenever a function call occurs in a tail position, call the function with the same continuation - cont
4. Whenever a function call occurs in an operand (non-tail) position, instead perform this call in a new continuation that gives a name to the result and continues with the expression
```
