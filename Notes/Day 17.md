# Day 17

### Date: August 24, 2022

### Topic

Java interop

### Notes

- (accidentally came across while trying to figure out what chunking does)
- `(java.util.Date.)` â†’ `(new java.util.Date)` instantiation
- `(.d getTime)` â†’ `(.getTime d)` instance method

---

### Topic

Chunking an Unchunked seq

### Notes

- For some reason there are no official docs on chunking functions. (seems to be intentional)
- (chunk-buffer) â†’ buffer of given capacity. It looks like the buffer is mutable, idk how that is, its not a java struct.
- (chunk-append) â†’ appends to buffer
- (chunk) â†’ returns an array chunk of the buffer (iChunk type)
- (chunked-cons) ??? idk canâ€™t figure it out

---

### Topic

CPS 

### Notes

- extra parameter return value
- inversion of control, you donâ€™t call things, they call you
- bookmarking a place in stack and code location
    - try throw catch. re-instantiating stack, wonâ€™t get a prev variable?
- two parts redex and continuation
