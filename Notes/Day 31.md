Practitioner

### Notes

- Figured out why stop was working. it was not the stop in threads and editor was getting confused.
- Added migrations. connection kept  closing until I used a datasource instead of URI. Not sure why one worked and not the other. Both methods are suggested in the documentation.
- Added db to the config, will add to env variables later.
- Read about mount, will try to implement tomorrow.
